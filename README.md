# Pathfinding Visualization Standalone Tool
Hello all, this is my CS545 final project. I Created a visualization for two different pathfinding algorithms operating in a navigable grid. The pathfinding algorithms I will be imple menting are A∗ and Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithms. Both of these pathfinding algorithms are very common in the game development world, and each has it’s own benefits and drawbacks. My goal is to create an executable that allows the user to specify the dimensions of the grid, mark the start and finish for the algorithm, and mark certain cells as “walls”, making those “walled” cells unwalkable. The appropriate pathfinding information would update on the visualization as the user is stepped through the pathfinding execution.

Hopefully you find this visualization interesting! Please let me know if there is anything not working as intended by contacting me at StruthersA@cwu.edu
